MINIPFASST
==========

MINIPFASST is a mini implementation of the Parallel Full Approximation
Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) algorithm.

Currently a very simple 1d advection/diffusion example is included in
MINIPFASST.  To run the example, modify examples/advection/Makefile to
your needs and:

$ cd examples/advection
$ make
$ mpirun -n 4 ./main.exe


Differences from LIBPFASST
==========================

MINIPFASST uses flat arrays to store solutions and function
evaluations instead of "encapsulations".

MINIPFASST defines transfer routines, SDC sweepers, and user data
contexts etc AT COMPILE TIME.

Please see:

* sweeper_dtype.f90 - this defines `type(pf_sweeper)`

* sweeper.f90 - this defines `sweeper_setup` and `sweeper_destroy`
                routines that are called per level

* user_dtype.f90 - this defines `type(pf_user)`

* user.f90 - this defines `user_setup` and `user_destroy` routines
             that are called per level

* transfer.f90 - this defines `interpolate` and `restrict` routines

Many routines (eg, sweep and transfer routines) get passed a
`type(pf_level)` structure which contains both `type(pf_sweeper)` and
`type(pf_user)` structures.  This provides a simple way of managing
and passing level specific data to sweeper and user routines.
